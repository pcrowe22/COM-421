Course Website
##############

I made this website several years ago, but I'm giving you the unfinished version to complete. You'll need to do the following:

	1. Fix the syntax and accessibility errors on the syllabus HTML file. Use the W3C validator to help you find the errors, and remember to look for incorrect elements (esp. <b> and <i>) and other accessibility mistakes from your readings (check navigation, headings, tables, metadata in <head>, etc.). It should pass the validator by the time you are done.
	
	2. Mark up the Play Review assignment in valid HTML5.
	
	3. Create a <nav> element on each page with proper relative links. 
	
I've included a screen shot of the Play Review page from the site I created to guide you in marking up the sematic elements on that page. Don't worry about styling the document; that's a separate issue.

When you've finished, submit your work as a .zip archive.
