    <h2>Evaluation</h2>

    <p>I&rsquo;ll evaluate you on your ability to apply skills and approaches to letter writing and document design that we learned in class to address the issues in each problem. Now that you have your style homework back, try to avoid repeat style errors.</p>

      <li>Label each question by number alone, in numerical order.</li>

      <li>Your file should be in .docx format only.</li>
      <li>Send your file as an attachment to this address: aroback@iit.edu.</li>
