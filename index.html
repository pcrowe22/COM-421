HW 5

 Try to put the instructions from the old Writing Exercise Three pdf (in this folder) into valid HTML5 format (the document is from the last time I taught the course). 
 
 I've put in all the text and <head> tags, so you just need to add structural tags to the body text. You'll need to use the following tags: h1, h2, p, strong, ol, li, and em. Remember, the basic rules for HTML5, especially that open tags must close in order. Use the W3C validator to make sure it's valid HTML5 before you submit. 
 
 Remember: HTML5 is about document structure. Don't worry about the appearance in a browser. Think about the the text in terms of its position in the information structure (is this a header? is it emphasized? is it a list? etc.).
 
 Modify special characters to be standard utf-8 characters in the text editor (special characters will screw up your validation).
